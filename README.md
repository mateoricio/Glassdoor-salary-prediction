# Glassdor Salary Prediction

In this Machine Learning problem our task is to predict the average salary of a Data Science realted job based on the data from Glassdoor.com and study the main factors of the highest paid jobs.

Since this is clearly a Supervised Regression Machine Learning Problem the first step will be to analyze and prepare the data and then select and train a Regressor stimator to give us the prediction expected.

The metric to dictate if the result is good will be R2, which is a metric very used in regression models. Our goal is to achive, at least, R2 â‰ˆ 0.7  (If the data allow us).
